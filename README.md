# Flappy Bird Game in Java

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game using **Java**. The game is built using Java's **Swing** framework and includes graphics, animations, and basic game mechanics. The player controls a bird that must navigate through pipes without hitting them, using the space bar to make the bird "flap" and rise.

## Features
- **Gameplay:** The bird constantly falls due to gravity, and the player can make it rise by pressing the space bar.
- **Pipes:** Pipes are generated at regular intervals, with random heights for the top pipe and a fixed gap for the bird to pass through.
- **Collision detection:** The game checks if the bird collides with pipes or the ground, resulting in a game-over state.
- **Score:** The score increases as the bird successfully passes through pipes, and is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or falls below the screen.
